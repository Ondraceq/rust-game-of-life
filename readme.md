# Game of Life in Rust

This project was inspired by youtube video (stream) "Jonathan Teaches Jason Rust! - Part 2".

The aim of this project is for me to learn the concepts of Rust

## Setup
The setup of this project should be straightforward if you are familiar with Rust.

Only thing to keep in mind is that this project uses SDL2 library, which may require a special setup (more info at [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2)).
